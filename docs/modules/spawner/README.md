# Spawner

## Description

This module provides the ability to mine spawners using silktouch   
to later place the empty spawner (snowball spawner)  
and change the type of spawner by using a spawnegg on it.

Which SpawnEggs can be used is based on permissions:

<code>
cubeengine.spawner.egg.*  Gives permissions for all the following spawneggs  
cubeengine.spawner.egg.creeper  
cubeengine.spawner.egg.sksleton  
cubeengine.spawner.egg.spider  
cubeengine.spawner.egg.zombie
